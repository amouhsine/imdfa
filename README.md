I-MDFA


This is a tracking repository for the
[MDFA code](http://blog.zhaw.ch/idp/sefblog/index.php?/archives/241-A-New-Category-I-MDFA-Code-Repository.html)
published and maintained on [SEF-Blog](http://blog.zhaw.ch/idp/sefblog/) by Marc Wildi. The code exists here on
github to simplify some work I am coordinating with Marc to produce an R package for MDFA, and *not* to create
a second access point for his MDFA code.

_BE_ _WARNED_- this is not the MDFA work area. This code will lag the main code, possibly by an intolerable amount.
It may contain egregious copy/paste errors, or worse. My efforts to incorporate signal extraction methods into
an lm-like framework may result in important functional or architectural errors. You should assume that I will
maliciously inject subtle errors into the calculation routines, particularly focused on disrupting your attempts
to productively use this code. The standard disclaimers about your use of this code and innocent kittens applies.

If you insist on using this code, (rather than simply clicking a URL to
[SEF-Blog]((http://blog.zhaw.ch/idp/sefblog/index.php?/archives/241-A-New-Category-I-MDFA-Code-Repository.html)
and downloading the real stuff) because you have heard me speak about MDFA, or have some misguided idea that I have
an inside line on where MDFA is going next, one hopes you have amazing programming skills and an affinity for
the complex plane that borders on otherworldly (and if so, you *really* should contact Marc directly).
